      <p>Painting has been a hobby I have embraced for quite some time. Ever since I took the paintbrush and just crafted something on paper, I have never looked back on it. Painting has been a hobby that gives me joy because I can draw my imaginations into an art piece and make the best out of it.Painting is my way of my emotions..I can breathe and paint, and after crafting my art, I feel at peace and relax because I put my focus and think peacefully about the matter. My friends have seen me paint when I am having issues, and they tend to note the tone of my painting reflects my mood because I paint based on issues of life.

Through hard work and the fact that I have learned the skill in painting my confidence has certainly improved. I have often showcased my work to those close to me and several exhibitions, not for sale but for the exchange of compliments.

Through the applaud of the excellent work I get in this hobby, my confidence in handling issues has undoubtedly improved.
